# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
This quiz was designed to test knowledge in regards to horror films. It has five questions in its entirety and it is timed from sixty seconds. The theme of it is based on "Saw", which I haved used PNG images to create a little bit more of a dynamic, atmospheric tone to the project through CSS. The application opens with a header and a description of the game and what it entails. The Start Quiz button is there to advance into the first question, and all questions have four options that are evenly spaced and the same size one on top of the other. The answers are in different slots, so no answer is in the same place. After every answer, if you get it correct, it reflects it by tallying up the scores using 'if' statements in a function. It goes either way if it's correct or incorrect and appropriately tallies everything up. The countdown from 60 seconds is displayed uderneath the options as you go through each question and counts down appropriately. If you hit zero without finishing the quiz, it will display "The jig is up. Game over." and retain your score either way.

At the end of the program, the submit score and the input text box shows up to put in your initials and it logs your score within localStorage, pairing it with your initials and placing the score, retained by the keys function, to the initials that are inputted into the system and displays them below the input box. 

What I learned from this project was ensuring that I am referencing online as well as peers in order to finish this. While I learned a lot from working through the modules, not all of it ended up helping me. So I was extremely adamant about learning on my own for this and doing my own research to figure out how things are put together. It was an extremely fun exercise and this will be going into my portfolio and being updated passed the grading period. It is a great start and a great way to continue to apply what I learn further into the bootcamp to this particular project.
